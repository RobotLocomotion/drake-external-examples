      # TODO(#248): On 2022-12-16 there were build failures being unable to
      # `brew upgrade python@3.10` during setup due to symlinks in
      # /usr/local/bin.  On 2023-01-03 there were similar failures with the
      # upgrade of 3.11.0 => 3.11.1.  When python@3.11 becomes the default for
      # drake, it should be ok to delete the `sanitize brew` step.  An
      # alternative may be to delete this section when the GHA ticket is solved:
