# Shambhala

Shambhala is a hidden kingdom (**Drake**) where Buddhist values and traditions rule. The
utopian realm is also home to the Great Warrior Gesar (**Russ Tedrake**), who leads hordes of the
righteous (**Drake Developers**) who will eventually ride into the human world to combat our demons (**intractable problems**).

More practically, this repository exemplifies various ways to open a pathway to using [Drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) in your own project.
