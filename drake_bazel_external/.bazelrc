# Pass along the compiler major version to Drake. This doesn't actually set or
# change the compiler used for the build, but tells Drake's CC rules what
# version to expect to tweak compiler- and version-specific flags accordingly.
# In particular, many warnings are suppressed when using gcc-13 (the default
# on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble). Adapt this flag to your system's compiler major
# version as necessary.

# For Ubuntu builds, this flag can cut build times in half. For macOS builds,
# this flag might cause build errors. We suggest turning it on if and only if
# your project doesn't use macOS.

# Drake supports the use of proprietary solvers for mathematical programs.

# and details on how to set them up.
# They can be enabled for the build and tests as shown below.
# Note that setting the --test_env below as 'build' flags is deliberate,
# to keep the analysis cache intact when switching between build and test.

# Enable Gurobi.

# Location of the Gurobi license key file, typically named "gurobi.lic".

# build --@drake//tools/flags:with_mosek=True
# Location of the MOSEK license file, typically named "mosek.lic".
